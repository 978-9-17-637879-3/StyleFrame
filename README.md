# StyleFrame: Run EECS280 style checks on your own computer â€” No CAEN needed!

## Requirements:
* A few gigabytes of available space

## Installation instructions:

Step 1: Install Docker

Note: do not make a docker account, it's completely unnecessary.

For Windows, follow [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/#install-docker-desktop-on-windows), then [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-containers#install-docker-desktop), steps 1 through 6 under "Install Docker Desktop"

For MacOS, follow [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/). Be sure to download the version that matches your system (Intel vs Apple chip)

For Linux, follow [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/), enable and start the docker service as well

Under settings in docker desktop, make sure "Start Docker Desktop when you log in" is enabled, and "Send usage statistics" + "Open Docker Dashboard at startup" are disabled

Step 2: Install StyleFrame

Download either the zip or tar.gz file from [the latest release](https://github.com/978-9-17-637879-3/StyleFrame/releases)

Extract the folder called style_frame_files into your project folder

Add the contents of AddToMakefile.txt to the bottom of your make file

Step 3: Prepare StyleFrame base

Wherever you normally run make commands, run `make create_style_frame`

If the installation was successful, you should see some licenses printed out that you have to read

## How to use:
